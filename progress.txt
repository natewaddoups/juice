		no memory leak found
		removed the pseudo-RTTI stuff in the Component class and derived classes

v163	Rebuilt installer with MSVC70x.dll and MSVCRT.dll
			
Priorities:

	GA interface
	external control interface	
	Grep for TODO
	undo-redo
	attach camera to body (or should this be a separate app?  JuiceArena?)



future features with Novodex dynamics library:
	use CollisionVeto to eliminate contacts between adjacent bodies
	Novodex sliders don't draw properly (no stretching, like old ODE sliders)	
	get terrain working w/ Novodex	
	"tack" support (will need to stop creating a body object for the 'tacked' body, as Novodex doesn't support the 'fixed' joint)
	cylinder collision hulls (no primitive for this at the moment)
	0-def joint for tacking objects to the environment
	hinge joint rGetAngle
	hinge joint motor: Novodex::RevoluteJoint::vAddForce (real rVel, real rForce)
	slider joint motor
	slider joint rGetExtension
	
Easy (?) bugs:
		
	don't allow position/orientation editing during simulation mode
	convert ground.ppm to ground.png (should get MUCH smaller file that way)
	close editbox microdlg on enter? no, not a bug
	
							
Hard Bugs:

	Window|Tile causes a bit of flicker during retiling, see notes in CMainFrame::OnTile

	mpeg dll stuff not real stable

	somehow the simpleant.jm files got hosed - joints referencing twins of the intended bodies, etc
	keep an eye out for that, if that happens again, find out why
						
Future features:
	
	support multiple file formats (XML, ODS, ?)
		create something analogous to the 'formatter' classes in C#
		
	Support ODE's Hinge-2 joint
	
	Support Novodex's many many joints
			
	clean up the separation between 'application' and 'editor' functionality
	
	get most headers (e.g. model.h) out of JuiceEngine.h so the dynamics DLLs won't need full rebuilds so often

	shift-drag to change look-at point
	
	undo/redo:
		delete object
		add object
		change object property (incl. position of network nodes?)

	get UI to use Selectable::m_pParent for hierarchies - could simplify the ModelTreeView?
		change components view to "explorer" style
		root items: model(s), environment(s)
		give the model a notion of 'root beam'
		make components tree update dynamically as items are expanded
		add 'set as root beam' menu item
		
	attach camera to a body
		create special "camera" component type?

	new behavior nodes should be cascaded, not piled up
	
	UI/sim support for hat switch, joystick buttons
	
	v1.X genetic algorithms tune behaviors
	v1.X attach arbitrary meshes to bodies (just for rendering purposes)
	
	draw joints with cool line-to-plane intersection stuff (add arms to hinges during simulation)	

	? merge function nodes and motor nodes into a single list in NetworkBehavior
		what about pointer-fixing... use iskindof to find/fix motor nodes?
		what else would that break?			
	
	fish-eye network view?
	
	clean up the clockworkbehavior and clockwork motor classes
		they're probably too complex due to the base class fork that happened for a while
		
	preferences dialog box 
		????	snap resolution
		real	cage size
		bool	pause animation for dialog boxes
		bool 	process only ground collisions
		bool	hide joints during simulation? (faster?)
		bool	use textures when drawing ground
		bool	collide with cage walls?

	toolbar buttons for drag planes
	
	selection rects
	
	render clipboard as XML (a small model file)

	physics dialog: separate params for body-ground and body-body contact params (friction/bounce/ERP/CFM)	
	motion view shows hand cursor over motion bars
	
	logging mechanism
	
Stuff to document in detail:
	physical constants for each dynamics library
		each factory should define a Serializable structure of the constants it needs
		each world should be able to get those constants from the factory during vPrepareSimulation
			factory gets a 'get constants' member
			world constructor take pointer to factory, stores that ptr in a world member
			vPrepareSim uses that pointer to call the factory's get constants member, initializes simulation w/ the constants
		when saving a model, the constant structs for each factory are saved with the model
		when loading a model, the constant structs are initialized from the file
	
New behavior system:
	the new behavior class consists of:
		a list of actions
			what is now network behavior should be coupled with a "Context"
			the pair will be called an action		
				e.g. stand on left foot
				e.g. lunge to right foot
		a list of "skills"
			a skill enables a group of actions (is factored into the context value)
				e.g. walk
				e.g. turn
		something (FCM? control net?) to shift power from one skill to another
				e.g. walk, turn, follow

Inelegancies:
	cannot pan & drag/pull at same time
		
environments
		add Environment class in JuiceEngine.h
		
		typedef std::list<StaticObject*> StaticObjectList
		
		class Environment
			StaticObjectList m_Static
			what else?
			gravity?

		class StaticObject
			typedef enum 
			{
				stInvalid=0,
				stBox, stTube, // stBall
			} Type;
			Type m_eType;
			VectorXYZ m_vecPosition;
			VectorYPR m_vecOrientation;
			VectorXYz m_vecBoxDimensions;
			real m_rTubeDiameter;
			real m_rTubeLength;
			// real m_rBallDiameter;

		?? class StaticObject : public Component ??
			
		add m_Environment to Application

		when going to sim mode, create collision objects

		//create project file object for .jp files
		//class JuiceProject
		//	std::string m_strModelPath;
		//	std::string m_strEnvironmentPath;
		
		make File|Open dialog support .jm & .je file types // and .jp 
		on .jm, open model; on .je, open environment
		//on .jp, open one of each

		if user opens model, adds static object, save as modelname.je by default
			make current doc modelname.jp	
			
To create a new network node class

	add declaration in Network.h... must include:
		property tree (at least create a base class tree and return a pointer to it)
		property getters and setters
		static creator function, for use by the FunctionNodeList class (serialization)
		
	implement that static creator (currently they're all at the top of NetworkBehavior.cpp)
		
	add two creator functions in Network.h
		one that returns a node pointer (who calls this, besides the fnInvoke wrapper?)
		one that returns void, to fit the fnInvoke property signature
		
	add serialization code in ModelFile.cpp
	add a line in NetworkBehavior::NetworkBehavior, to prime the function node list serializer
				
	
	
// linear motor
//
// similar in function to angular motor, but 
// (a) controls only one axis; 
// (b) controls linear, not angular, motion
// (c) axis is always relative to body 1

struct dxJointLMotor : public dxJoint {
  dVector3 axis; // motor axis
  dxJointLimitMotor limot;
};
