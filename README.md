In late 2001, I set out to build a small walking robot, and figured I would start
by simulating it, using Russ Smith's Open Dynamics Engine (see http://ode.org/). 
Specifying robot geometry in C++ was hard, so I started building a GUI to
define and "motorize" jointed rigid bodies.

One thing led to another, and I ended up with a GUI that I was quite proud of, complete
with a built-in visual programming language to specify robot motion. I even had a virtual
biped walking around under joystick control. But I never did get the actual robot to walk. 

Life continued, other hobbies took over, and I forgot about the whole thing. 

Ten years later, I couldn't get it to compile with then-current compilers.

Twenty years later, I figured I should get it compiled again, and put it on GitHub. 

It's going to need more rehabilitation. But, to my great surprise, it mostly works.

I don't remember why I named it Juice.
