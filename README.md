# Juice

In late 2001, I set out to build a small walking robot, and figured I would start
by simulating it. Coincidentally, Russ Smith had just released the Open Dynamics Engine
(see http://ode.org/) so the math was a solved problem. Specifying robot geometry in C++
was hard though, so I started building a GUI to assembly jointed rigid bodies.

One thing led to another, and I ended up with a GUI that I was quite proud of, complete
with a built-in visual programming language to specify robot motion. I even had a virtual
biped walking around under joystick control.

I never did get the actual robot walking. Life continued, other hobbies took over, and I
forgot about the whole thing.

Ten years later, I couldn't get it to compile with current compilers.

Twenty years later, I figured I should at least put it on GitHub.

I don't remember why I named it Juice.
